# findFile

searching for a file in a directory, traversing recursively

Code from http://book.mixu.net/node/ch11.html

## v1.0
Due to the nature of program <del>(it's async)</del> I may get more then one found!

And how to test when there is no match (found)? Hmm ðŸ¤”

## v2.0
Use EventEmmiter

The code in the [book]: (http://book.mixu.net/node/ch11.html) does not use
*End* event. Maybe it is a good idea?

```console
$ uname -a
```
